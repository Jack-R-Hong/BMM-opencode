# Sprint Status Template
# This is an EXAMPLE showing the expected format
# The actual file will be generated with all epics/stories from your epic files

# generated: {date}
# project: {project_name}
# project_key: {project_key}
# tracking_system: {tracking_system}
# story_location: {story_location}

# STATUS DEFINITIONS:
# ==================
# Epic Status:
#   - backlog: Epic not yet started
#   - in-progress: Epic actively being worked on
#   - done: All stories in epic completed
#
# Story Format:
#   status: backlog | ready-for-dev | in-progress | review | done
#   depends_on: [] (list of story keys this story depends on, within same epic)
#
# Story Status Flow:
#   backlog → ready-for-dev → in-progress → review → done
#
# Retrospective Status:
#   - optional: Can be completed but not required
#   - done: Retrospective has been completed
#
# DEPENDENCY NOTES:
# =================
# - depends_on lists story keys that MUST be 'done' before this story can start
# - Only intra-epic dependencies are tracked (cross-epic deps handled by epic ordering)
# - Stories with empty depends_on [] can start immediately
# - dev-team-mode "delegate" execution mode uses depends_on for auto-scheduling
#
# Dependency Calculation Priority:
#   1. Explicit "Depends On" field in epic file (authoritative when present)
#   2. Prose references in story text ("depends on Story X.Y", "requires X.Y")
#   3. Sequential default: each story depends on the previous story in the epic
#   First story in each epic always has depends_on: []
#
# WORKFLOW NOTES:
# ===============
# - Mark epic as 'in-progress' when starting work on its first story
# - SM typically creates next story ONLY after previous one is 'done' to incorporate learnings
# - Dev moves story to 'review', then Dev runs code-review (fresh context, ideally different LLM)
